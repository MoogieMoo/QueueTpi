# QueueTpi
## Datian Zhang, Maggie Xia, Adris Jaoutakas

We chose these methods:
+ add
##### addFirst() and addLast() add items to the deque
+ remove
##### removeFirst() and removeLast() remove items to the deque
+ get
##### getFirst() and getLast() return the items in the deque
+ isEmpty()
##### checks if the deque is empty
+ size()
##### returns the size of the deque

### Because they are the basic functions of a data structure and are consistent with the methods that we had implemented before in Stack and Queue.

### We chose to use an Arraylist for Deque because it was easier to implement than DLL and it was more flexible than Array, where size is unchangeable.

We left out these methods"
+ offer
##### same functionality as add except does not throw exception
+ poll
##### same functionality as remove except does not throw exception
+ peek
##### same functionality as get except does not throw exception
