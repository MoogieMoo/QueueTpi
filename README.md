# QueueTpi
## Datian Zhang, Maggie Xia, Adris Jaoutakas

We chose these methods:
+ add()
##### addFirst() and addLast() add items to the deque
+ remove()
##### removeFirst() and removeLast() remove items to the deque
+ peek()
##### peekFirst() and peekLast() peek at items in the deque
+ isEmpty()
##### checks if the deque is empty
+ size()
##### returns the size of the deque

### Because they are the basic functions of a data structure and are consistent with the methods that we had implemented before in Stack and Queue.

### We chose to use an Arraylist for Deque because it was easier to implement than DLL and it was more flexible than Array, where size is unchangeable.
