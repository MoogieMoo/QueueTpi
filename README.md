# QueueTpi
### Datian Zhang, Maggie Xia, Adris Jaoutakas

We chose these methods:
*add
*remove
*peek
*isEmpty
*size 

Because they are the basic functions of a data structure and are consistent with the methods that we had implemented before in Stack and Queue.
We chose to use an Arraylist for Deque because it was easier to implement than DLL and it was more flexible than Array, where size is unchangeable.
